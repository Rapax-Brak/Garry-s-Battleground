## How to report admins

First you will need to have a claim this can include any claim you wish from the rules above 

Second you must have evidence this can include Audio, Video, Voice or Witnesses 

Third you must make a fourm post on the fourms there is a Admin Report section make a post and management this includes Head of Staff, Community Manager, Staff Manager, Manager, and Owner will take a look at it

if your application is being investigated we will send you a message and when it is denied we will send you a message along with a reason and if it is accepted we will send you a message including why it was accepted, what that admins punishment will be and a thank you along with 1000 cosmetic points

Do not be afraid to report high ranking staff members all staff members must follow the rules just as players this includes Mods, Admins, Super Admins, Head of Staff, Staff Manager, Manager, and Owner/Founder clearly we cannot demote the Owner/Founder but if he is found abusing his power you have my Gurantee as Manager he will be slapped by him self recorded and posted to the fourms each and every single time he is reported and proven guilty.

### How to become an admin

First you must be an active player witnessed by many a player and admin alike.

Second you must be liked by the community and staff, to prove this you will need to gather 3 players and 1 staff to vouch for you in the comments of your application

Third you must make an application, this can be accomplished through the fourms
Some requirements are but not limited to:

Must be 15 or older or the maturity level to match

Must have a Mic 

Must have 3 Users and 1 Staff vouch for them 

Must pass the interview process

Fourth you must pass the interview process, in this you will be forced to read EVERY SINGLE RULE AND PUNISHMENT OUTLOUD to one of the managerial people, then be quizzed on it and asked some personal questions this is only if we accept your written application

Now lets say you have done all of this but you are still not getting a reply. This may be; because, we are full on staff or we just don't want to hurt your feelings by being declined.

"How do I get higher priority" you may ask this question and the answer is to be a donator, donators get higher placement when looking for admins because we know they would not support us finically if they did not love our servers.
